      <h1>Burn Out in Caring Professions</h1>
  
      <p>Burn Out in Caring Professions
  Are you exhausted? Feeling stressed? Not sure if you can keep going? I know how you feel because I was the same.
  <br>
  
  <ul>The WHO goes on to say burnout is characterized by three dimensions:
    <br>
    <br>
    <li>feelings of energy depletion or exhaustion</li>
    <br>
    <li>increased mental distance from one’s job, or feelings of negativism or cynicism related to one’s job</li>
    <br>
    <li>reduced professional efficacy</li>
  </ul>
  <p>I have helplessly watched too many wonderful people at caring professions burning out. You care so much about your students, patients, or customers, your mind is working well beyond working hours, often until very late at night. You do so much for the wellbeing of others.
  </p>
  <p> I took time off teaching to learn how to take care of my mind through meditation and yoga.  Now I want to share some of what I have learnt, so that you can be free from busy mind.

      <h1>Different Types of Yoga</h1>
  
      <p>I am often asked “What kind of Yoga do you teach?” </p>
      <p>You might have heard of many different types of yoga and are wondering what they all are. Eight popular styles of yoga are Ashtanga yoga, Hatha yoga, Hot yoga, Iyengar yoga, Kundalini yoga, Power yoga, Restorative yoga, Vinyasa yoga.</P>
      <p>There are so many more and new ones are popping up every so often.</p>
      <p>I am not going to explain each of them because that has been done by many people, so go ahead and search online if you would like to find out more about them.</p>
      <p>I acquired my teaching certificate through Santosha Yoga Institute. In my yoga training course, I have practised Ashtanga Yoga, Vinyasa Yoga, Vini Yoga, Yoga Therapy, Pre and Post Natal Yoga, Yoga Nidra, Trauma Sensitive Yoga, Yin Yoga and Meditation. </p>
      <p>All the classes taught me how to teach yoga in a safe way. There was  a lot about anatomy, correct alignment, the philosophy of yoga and spiritual development.</p>
      </p>
      <p>So when people asks me ‘What kind of Yoga do you teach ?’</p>
      <p>I would like to reply, ‘I teach Yoga intelligently and safely to my students for what they require for their Yoga practice.</p>
       <p>Looking forward to guiding you to your Yoga practice soon.</p>
