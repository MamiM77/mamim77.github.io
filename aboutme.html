      <p class="blurbme">I was born in Japan and migrated to Australia when I was 23 years old. I have Japanese parents and speak Japanese and English.
I was an English teacher in Japan, then became a primary school teacher in Australia, teaching Japanese to primary school students. I live with a very kind- hearted Australian husband and two cats (Tilly and Yuki) in Victoria, Australia.
<br>
<br>
I love travelling, meeting people, and I love teaching Yoga and Meditation.
<br>
<br>
I have practised Yoga for over 10 years, then the COVID outbreak allowed me to take time to study Yoga in depth, leading me to become a qualified Yoga Instructor.
I believe "connection" is a key to modern life. Connect to nature, connect to people and connect to yourself.
<br>
<br>
This is the reason why all my classes are live, not recorded.
Practising Yoga and Meditation has helped me to live a more balanced life. It has given the tools to cope with stress, tension and consequently allowed me to experience a lot more joy and peaceâ€‹
